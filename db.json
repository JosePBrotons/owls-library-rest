The ending was a kind of disappointment... It has so many things to feel and discuss (not all good, not all bad). I would say more, but ‚Äúno spoilers‚Äù. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I do recommend the book. The author writes really well, and the story is enjoyable and intriguing."

I am never disappointed!"
